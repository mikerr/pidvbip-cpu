Known bugs and unimplemented features

AUDIO-RELATED

* Remove duplicated audio code in MPEG and AAC codecs and improve PCM API (create ao_pi?)

* AAC/HE-AAC - correctly initialise codecdata based on info from tvh (stream info or a ADTS header).  Also test format changes.

* Implement E-AC3 codec (? Is ffmpeg the only open source E-AC3 codec?)

* AC-3 decoder always downmixes to Stereo - can we output 5.1 over HDMI?

* Implement HW pass-through of AC-3 (and other codecs?) - detect HDMI audio capabilities and send raw data when possible.

* Deal with different channels/samplerate etc in MPEG audio codec (currently hard-coded for 48KHz Stereo)


VIDEO-RELATED

* Improve A/V sync for hardware decoded video - A/V sync currently works quite well, but needs to be done properly with OMX clocks.

* Deal with software MPEG-2 stream not being decoded fast enough (queue will grow forever)

* Implement double-buffering in software MPEG-2 codec to eliminate tearing

* Clear the framebuffer/add a black background image so any framebuffer text isn't visible during channel changes or when displaying 4:3 video.


CORE FEATURES

* Implement an OSD API and build a UI.

* Review channel change implementation - ensure things are being
  opened/closed appropriately and there are no memory leaks.  pidvbip
  freezes if you change channel too quickly in succession.

* Properly deal with S64 integers in htsp.c (code currently sometimes assumes they are all 32-bit)

* Catch ^C and reset keyboard (and cleanly close down codecs)

* Deal with network disconnections from tvheadend - test killing tvheadend, removing network cable etc...

* Implement subtitles

* Deal with off-air channels.

* Collect EPG data from server and maintain internal EPG database

* Support connecting to multiple servers, merging channel list.  Servers will be listed in priority order, and duplicate channels renumbered to a high range (e.g. 1000+)

* Add LIRC input support

* Integrate with OpenELEC

* avahi discovery only returns the first discovered instance of tvheadend
